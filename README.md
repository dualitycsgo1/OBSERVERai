- **Map Knowledge**: Understands positioning and angles on different maps
- **Meta Adaptation**: Adapts to current CS2 meta and weapon balance changes
- **Personalization**: Learns from your specific game scenarios and preferences

### How to Train New Models

#### Step 1: Collect Demo Files
1. **Download CS2 demos** (.dem files) from:
   - Your own matches (MM, Faceit, ESEA)
   - Professional matches (HLTV, tournament websites)
   - High-level pugs or scrims

2. **Place demo files** in the `demos/` folder

#### Step 2: Launch AI Trainer
```bash
# Standalone version
CS2AITrainer.exe

# Or double-click
ðŸ§  Start AI Trainer.bat

# Python version  
python ai_trainer_gui.py
```

#### Step 3: Process Demos
1. **Click "Import Demos"** - Select your .dem files
2. **AI processes each demo** extracting:
   - Player positions at moment of kills
   - Weapon types and ammunition states
   - Health and armor values
   - Round context and economic factors
   - Map-specific positioning data

3. **Watch real-time statistics:**
   - Total kills processed
   - Maps analyzed
   - Training samples generated
   - Processing speed (kills/second)

#### Step 4: Train the Model
1. **Click "Train AI Model"** after processing demos
2. **AI training begins** using machine learning algorithms:
   - Random Forest classification
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Cross-validation testing
   - Hyperparameter optimization

3. **Training results show:**
   - Model accuracy percentage
   - Feature importance rankings
   - Training/validation split results
   - AIIMS intelligence score

#### Step 5: Automatic Integration
- **Model automatically saved** to `models/` folder
- **Observer detects new model** within 30 seconds
- **Hot-reload activates** - no restart needed!
- **AI immediately uses** improved predictions

### Understanding AIIMS Statistics

**AIIMS (AI Intelligence Measurement System)** provides detailed metrics:

- **Overall Accuracy**: Percentage of correct kill predictions
- **Map-Specific Performance**: How well AI performs on each map
